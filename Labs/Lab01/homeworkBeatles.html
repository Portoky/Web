        <p><b>The Beatles</b> were an English rock band formed
        in Liverpool in 1960, comprising</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>John Lennon</li>
            <li>Paul McCartney</li>
            <li>George Harrison</li>
            <li>Ringo Starr</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They are regarded as the most 
        influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s
        counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. Rooted in
        skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical
        music and traditional pop in innovative ways.</br> The band also explored music styles ranging 
        from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and 
        artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often 
        publicized as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</p>
